      <p>The Daily Drawing Project was the start of my journey to graphic design and illustration. On January 1st, 2016 I made a new year's resolution to complete one illustration every single day for an entire year. I chose a sketchbook with small dimensions and decided that I would stick with pen and ink as my tools, in an effort to keep the project as simple as possible.</p>
      <p>I have maintained this project and completed a daily drawing every day since January 1st, 2016. As of the date that I am writing this, I have completed 1013 illustrations as a part of this project. Some days it is hard and some days it is easy. Some days I spend hours drawing and some days I can barely squeeze in 5 minutes to doodle something simple. This project demonstrates my ability to persist with a project and my commitment to my development as an illustrator.</p>
