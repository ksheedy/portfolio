      <p>Fire Face is an independent game development studio located in Ottawa, Canada. Itâ€™s existing logo was designed by me in 2015. Fire Face has a logo only, and no other branding scheme. Fire Face is undertaking this brand refresh project because they will soon be announcing a big new project. Fire Face needed a better, more professional logo and an expanded and cohesive brand. This project included a logo refresh, a logo reveal motion piece, a new website design and a set of brand guidelines.</p>
