      <p>This piece was inspired by the world contained inside of a book. With simple handmade props the story of a series of library books is told. This piece was developed to promote the Ottawa Public Library and create a fun visual representation of the many worlds contained in the library’s many volumes. This piece was created using stop motion photography and it was edited together using After Effects.</p>
